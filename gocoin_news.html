<h1>Latest News</h1>
<h2>18th February 2026</h2>
Recently there have been 2 different consensus compatibility issues 
discovered by <a href="https://github.com/brunoerg" target="_blank">@brunoerg</a><br>
They both have been fixed and the fixes are already available on the master branch.<br>
We have not observed anything in the BTC network that would use any of these un-compatible
opcodes, but be advised to upgrade. <br>
<br>
On top of that, the upcoming <b>1.11.1</b> release will use less memory and should perform faster
in most cases (especially for the initial chain download).<br>
Current master branch (<b>1.11.1pre</b>) already has all these upgrades implemented,
so feel free to try it out and please report any issues you encounter.<br>

<h2>13th November 2025</h2>
<b>Gocoin 1.11.0 has been released.</b><br>
<br>
A big part of the codebase was hugely reworked.<br>
The client should perform significantly better, comparing to the previous 1.10.x versions.<br>
With a fast internet connection, you should observe an improvement in the initial chain sync time.<br>
Also the memory pool management performs better now, although this is rather hard to observe.<br>
